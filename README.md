In this work, We propose **S**tep-Level **T**raj**e**ctory **Ca**libration (**STeCa**), a novel framework for improving LLM agents. 
Specifically, \model identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during explorations. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training.
